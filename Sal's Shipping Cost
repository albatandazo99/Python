#Project background:Sal runs the biggest shipping company in the tri-county area, Sal’s Shippers. Sal wants to make sure that every single one of his customers has the best, and most affordable experience shipping their packages.
#In this project, I built a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package using Sal’s Shippers.
